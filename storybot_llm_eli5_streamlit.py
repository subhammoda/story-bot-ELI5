Powered by CrewAI and Gemini-2.0-Flask, it takes any topic you enter, researches it, simplifies it, and transforms it into a fun, age-appropriate story â€” just like a children's book. Whether you're a parent, teacher, or just curious, this is the perfect way to make complex ideas beautifully simple.")
